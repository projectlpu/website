            While the amount of non renewable energy resource are decreasing and energy consumption and its price are increasing , government are looking for ways to provide energy efficiency and conservation that not only decreases the use of the use of energy but also the strong economic for governments and greener environment for people .</p>

        <b><center>IMPORTANCE OF ENERGY CONSERVATION</center></b>
        <p>It plays a significant role of lessening climate change it helps the replacement of non renweable resource with renwewablke energy. Energy conservation is often the most inexpensive solution to energy shortage and it is more environmentally kind alter native to increase energy production.
            <li> IT is very important to preserve energy from our current supply or to utilise renewable resource so that it is also available to our future generation.
            </li>
            <li> Over use of energy cause, some iassuse include a danger to human body health ,impact on cost of living.</li>
            <li> IT reduce the global warming because it has its own consequence in our atmosphere.</li></p>

            <b><center>ENERGY CONSERVATION IDEAS</center></b>
            <p>Green conversation companies have a very important role in preserving the non -renewable resource of earth the longer we conserve existing energy the longer will be the life of non-renewable energy resource like coal & oil gas.
            the primary benefite of energy conservation is that it help the publice and the government in saving money . Business and local government by proper conservation of energy.</p>
            
            <b><center>ENERGY CONSERVATION OPPORTUNITIES</center></b>
            <p><li> In addition recent development of smart phone apps enable homeowners to complete relative sophisticated energy audits themselves.</li>
            <li> This is normally accomlished by trained professional can be part of some of the national program.</li>
            <li> One of the primary ways to improve energy conservation is to use an use an energy audit.</li>
            <li> An energy audit is an inspection and analysis of energy use and flows for energy conservation in a building , process or system to reduce the amount of energy input into the system without negatively affecting the output.</li></p>
            
            
            <b><center>ENERGY CONSERVATION ESSAY</center></b>
            The energy on earth is not in unlimited supply .Furthermore energy can take plenty of time to regenerate .This certainly makes it essential to conserve energy .Most noteworthy,energy conservation is achievable either by using energy efficiently or by reducing the amount of service usage .First of all energy conservation plays an important role in saving non renewable energy resource. Furthermore ,non renewable energy source take many centuries to regenerate. Moreover , humans consume energy at a faster rate than it can be produce . Therefore ,energy conservation would lead to the preservation sources of energy . Energy conservation will reduce the expenses related to fossil fuels. fossil fuels are very expensive to mine .Therefore ,consumers are required to pay higher prices for goods service . Energy conservation would certainly reduce the amount of fossil fuel being mined . This ,in turn would reduce the costs of consumers . Consequently , energy conservation would strengthen the economy as consumers will have more disposable income to spend on goods and service. Energy conservation is good for scientific research . This is because energy conservation gives researchers plenty of time to conduct researcher .Therefore , these researcher will have more time to come up with various energy solution and alternative . Humans must ensure to have fossil fuels as long as possible . This would give me enough time to finding practical solution .</p>
